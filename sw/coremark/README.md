# Introduction

CoreMark's primary goals are simplicity and providing a method for testing only a processor's core features. For more information about EEMBC's comprehensive embedded benchmark suites, please see www.eembc.org.

For a more compute-intensive version of CoreMark that uses larger datasets and execution loops taken from common applications, please check out EEMBC's [CoreMark-PRO](https://www.github.com/eembc/coremark-pro) benchmark, also on GitHub.

This project folder is a port of CoreMark (from the official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eembc/coremark)) for the processor. Based on the NEORV32 version.

# Building

To build the executable (`coremark.srec`) of the benchmark, type:

`> make clean all`

To build the executable for a certain CPU configuration and a certain optimization level of the benchmark, type (`Ofast` in this example):

`> make EFFORT=-Ofast clean all`

# Scores

The current design has a Coremark speed of 2.22 coremarks/MHz with an average CPI of 1.53.

# Running

Upload the generated executable `coremark.srec` with the `upload` program: `make upload` using `-O3` optimzation.
